            I was born on Friday 1, June 2004. I was an ordinary boy who grew up in Kampong Cham of Cambodia; It locates
            on the central lowlands of the Mekong River. After I saw a first light of the a glorious world, my grandma
            gave me a name "Sok-heng"; In khmer, it means peaceful and lucky. Hahaha such a great name. I don't think
            that I'm lucky like my name.

            I spent six years at Government school before I came to Liger Leadership Academy in Phnom Penh. It was
            twisted my mind and my life.
            The way I see the world from one day to anothers have changing becuase Liger provided me a lot of education.
            Besides, I have joined
            many events that were happening in my society. I pledge to walk on a right track to fulfill Liger's dream.

    On my personal time, I enjoy doing my favorite sport and skill. Every weekend, I would go to the field with my peers
    and spend
    time at least one to two hours just running and catching a frisbee. for skill, I like to paint and draw on my free
    time.
    For the future goal is, I want to become a famous architect and create a new amazing Kampuchea. Sometimes.... Haha I
    spend the
    rest of my life with phone. JK. I like to watch video on Utube and checking social medias like Facebook and
    Instargram. Oh!!, my
    God <HOMEWORK> is calling me BYE. OHH !! wait, wait..... I DON't LIKE football. "Sorry"
