        Cambodia is one of the countries among others, whose share the border between neighboring
        countries but
        in terms of the land, Cambodia owns the ocean along to the west region of the country: Kep,
        Kampot,
        Sihanoukville, and Koh Kong. To illustrate that, this attractive beach catches the tourists’
        attention
        to visit every year, therefore, Cambodian workers can earn more income by running restaurants,
        hotels,
        fishing, and etc. On the other hand, Ocean’s playing a significant role in the economy industry,
        transport the import products and export products throughout the country. Besides that,
        recently,
        research estimates that Khmer’s ocean has 545 species presented. These fascinating creatures are
        to
        preserve but several study researchers aren’t yet discovering and begin to dig out to the depth
        of ocean’s
        exploration, however, Marine Conservation Cambodia steps out to protect and help to prevent
        threats due to
        the illegal activities that appear in Koh Seh tropical island.
        The mysterious diversity, aliens organisms live and depend down there such as vertebrates
        species, invertebrates
        species, bioluminescence and more.

        Identity is the one who shows your origin, Without identity, it is very complicated to identity to know who you
        are? In the whole universe, the human has different genes to define themselves in uncommon style. A human being
        different from one to another. Both Minority faction and majority faction, the way that they work are truly
        contrast. Minority community on earth are very separate from each other. In Kampuchea, There are many types of
        indigenous group that still exist. One of an indigenous group is almost existing is “Stieng”. This group is
        mostly depending on agriculture as the main job. On April-May, which is a rainy season in Kampuchea, so
        everybody is preparing to farm for the rest of the year. The crops that Stieng people farm are cassava, pepper,
        rubber and cashew nut.

        The day of 13 November was a very first day that I got a chance to go to Mondoul Kiri province to learn how to
        survive in the wood without nice stuff with. This was the second trip in Outdoor Leadership Project. It was so
        wonderful to see all the creatures in Mondoul Kiri and there are so many mountains that I couldn’t count all of
        it. Tuesday, was a day of a long drive to this province. Along a road to this province, I was doing Sudoku with
        my friends next to me on the bus, also our teachers ask us to write something that we excited about, something
        that we nervous about, and goals during the trip as well.

        When I went to Tamao mountain, I felt like I was in a deep and deep forest that I never been to before, it was
        my first to go there, sitting on the bus and look at the Cambodia scenery views until arrived the zoo. I went to
        Tamao zoo, I saw a lot of animals because this mountain also includes Zoo and history mountain. My exploration
        members went to this mountain with my two lovely teachers to go with us. I got to go there because my teacher
        wants us to know more about the animals in Cambodia. There was a guide to told us direction and told the
        information there. How each animal gets their food to eat and what types of habitat that animals live and other
        questions. Overall, it was a long walk, and I was so surprised to see all of those animals. I hope that I will
        go back to see all of them again.
